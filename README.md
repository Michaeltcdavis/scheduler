# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is a React application that allows a user to navigate through interview times and days of the week to book, edit and cancel interviews.

The website is built with React components and uses custom hooks to separate functions communicating with its API.

The website was tested using Storybook for unit tests, jest for integration tests and Cypress for end-to-end tests.
